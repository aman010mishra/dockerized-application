## 🚀 DevOps and Deployment

This project follows a **DevOps-centric workflow** to ensure scalable, secure, and automated deployment. The complete application is containerized using **Docker**, and service orchestration is managed using **Docker Compose**. A multi-stage **CI/CD pipeline** is configured with **GitHub Actions** to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

### 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline

- **Tool Used**: GitHub Actions
- **Trigger**: Every push to the `main` branch
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout the latest code
  2. Set up Docker and Docker Compose
  3. Securely generate `.env` file using GitHub Secrets
  4. Build Docker images for both `frontend` and `backend`
  5. Push images to Docker Hub
  6. [Optionally] Pull the latest image on Render for deployment

### 🐳 Docker & Compose

- Each service (frontend, backend) is containerized using its own Dockerfile.
- Services are orchestrated using `docker-compose.yml`, which manages:
  - Networking (custom Docker network)
  - MongoDB service (for local development)
  - Port mappings and container health
  - Shared volumes (for MongoDB persistence)

### 🔐 Secret Management

Sensitive information like:
- `MONGO_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`

...are managed via **GitHub Secrets**, injected at runtime during CI/CD to ensure security and compliance.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment

The app is deployed on **Render** using prebuilt Docker images from **Docker Hub**:
- `chatapp-frontend`
- `chatapp-backend`

Each service is independently hosted with environment variables set through the Render dashboard.
